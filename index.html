        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p id="abouttext">I am an AI enthusiast and self-driven learner, passionate about acquiring new skills and staying at the forefront of technology. Proficient in Python, Java, and C, I also have expertise in MySQL, Power BI, Machine Learning, Web Development, and Android Development.

            In a recent academic project, I implemented a disease prediction system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and integrated it with a mobile application to enhance the user experience, leveraging ChatGPT for assistance. Additionally, I actively participate in hackathons such as Centuriton, ML Hackathon, and Smart India Hackathon (SIH), which have significantly strengthened my problem-solving and technical skills.
            
            I am currently seeking a challenging AI project to further expand my expertise and contribute innovative solutions to real-world problems.</p>
